*X-Glide, winner of the Study Your Arts event*

I competed and [reported](https://whro.org/news/local-news/37983-study-your-arts-brings-black-club-culture-to-something-in-the-water) on the Study Your Arts dance competition at this year's Something in the Water festival in VA Beach. It was a blast to return to the dance scene where my artistic journey began and be able to give back by covering the event as a journalist. So much talent among the young dancers - I'm excited to see what happens next. I also published a video recap on my dancer Youtube profile:
