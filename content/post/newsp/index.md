I started a podcast this month where I interview journalists and media people about the challenges of the modern news industry and what they're doing to get over the pitalls. My first episode features a former opinions editor who started a successful Substack newsletter after he got laid off, and my second features a journalist union leader who went on strike for better wages on Feb. 1. More to come!
