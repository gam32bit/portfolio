![Lawrenceville Correctional Center](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lawrenceville_prison_JWC-1024x658.jpg)

I published [my first article in the Virginia Mercury](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/virginia-considers-private-prison-contract-renewal-despite-4-3-million-in-breaches/) on the only privately run prison in Virginia, Lawrenceville Correctional Center. I obtained a series of memos from the Virginia Department of Corrections that showed GEO Group, the private operator, has had $4.3 million in contract breaches since 2018. I uploaded the [memos](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/lawrenceville-correctional-center-212905/) to DocumentCloud along with the [contract and other related documents.](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/lawrenceville-correctional-center-contract-documents-212906/)
