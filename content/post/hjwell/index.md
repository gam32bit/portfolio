In my [previous reporting](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-jamestown-tours-20230517-edqzdituhjhghldamfyciad7ru-story.html) on [Historic Jamestown](https://www.dailypress.com/resizer/lGT2yn9NaOELyUv_fUWLJnnMKtE=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/4AZ4NLCH65GLVBQMGTQUNL3TNI.JPG), I've mentioned past well excavations they've done, but it is exciting to be able to [report on one happening in real time.](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/08/23/digging-deeper-jamestown-archaeologists-begin-excavations-inside-well-found-last-year/) The team there has been super welcoming and even let me climb into the excavation cribbing around the dig. Who knows what they'll find?
