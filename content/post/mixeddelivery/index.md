[Virginia's Mixed Delivery program,](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/19/despite-success-va-public-private-program-for-early-childhood-care-still-far-from-meeting-need/) which gives public dollars to private early childhood care providers, has made strides over the past several years, but challenges remain in expanding the program further to reach more families across the state. The program enjoys bipartisan support but faces funding limitations, highlighting the need for continued investment in early childhood education to ensure all families have access to quality care.
