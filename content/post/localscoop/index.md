This was one of those stories where I just wrote about something I was already doing - [going out to cafes to get work done as a freelance journalist.](https://www.localscoopmagazine.com/food-drink/the-top-williamsburg-caf%C3%A9-getaways-for-remote-workers/) I've never written for a culture magazine like this piece, so I can mark another milestone in my writing career!
