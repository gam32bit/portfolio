Today I published a [story for Virginia Mercury](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/more-patients-in-crisis-falling-through-cracks-of-state-psychiatric-commitment-system/) about failures of the state's psychiatric system, specifically not having enough beds to accomodate those in mental health crisis. I recorded a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9IDL8eruAw) on how I was able to write some simple code in Python to extract, analyze, and visualize the data from a public records request that became the basis of this story.
