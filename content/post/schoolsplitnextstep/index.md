When I originally covered [this story,](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/13/james-city-county-delays-decision-on-school-division-split/) I based it off the ["Joint Resolution"](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23981218-9bf35d27-8ab5-4854-a6ad-15c4d6aaef70) that had been attached to the meeting agenda for the item. When the resolution was voted on and approved after a closed session, board member John McGlennon who made the motion only mentioned two amendments to the school year dates. I asked the county to provide a hard copy of the approved resolution, but I did not hear back from them until after the story was published, when they provided me with [the new version of the resolution.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23981222-jtreswjccsept12) I've uploaded both on DocumentCloud so readers can compare for themselves.
