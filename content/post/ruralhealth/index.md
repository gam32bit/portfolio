My last article for Virginia Mercury before I started my new job at [Virginia Sea Grant](https://jwcaterine.com/p/i-now-work-for-va-sea-grant/) was [months in the making.](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/in-rural-virginia-communities-struggle-to-find-enough-health-care-workers/) I traveled to the ODU mobile clinic in South Virginia and to the free health clinic in the Northern Neck as part of my investigation into the [lack of healthcare in rural Virginia.](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/in-rural-virginia-communities-struggle-to-find-enough-health-care-workers/) Check out the walkthrough of the mobile clinic below!
