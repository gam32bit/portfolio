It does not appear that the state has anyway to force school boards to adopt the Virginia Department of Education's model policies which make it more difficult for transgender students to go by their preferred identity at school, [according to my reporting.](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/)

The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that LGBTQ youth who said they had a LGBTQ-affirming school system reported lower rates of attempting suicide. A 2021 GLSEN survey of School Climate for LGBTQ+ Students in Virginia reported that only 40% of Virginian LGBTQ+ students said that their school administration was “somewhat or very supportive” of LGBTQ+ students.

I really admire the students and families who are organizing against these policies and led a mass walkout last year when they were first announced. You can support [Pride Liberation Project here.](https://prideliberation.org/)
