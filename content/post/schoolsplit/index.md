I spoke with a few different sources after [James City County announced it would end its contract with the school division](https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/07/28/as-school-debate-continues-teachers-can-only-watch-and-wait/), and people were in shock. I will be covering the school board work session tomorrow, where the superintendent is expected to speak publicly for the first time on it. Will be interesting to see how this issue develops into the fall, when the City of Williamsburg plans to start its feasibility study on starting its own school division.
