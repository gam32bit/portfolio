My first two articles for Richmond Inno include a look at [Charlottesville company Bonumose](https://www.bizjournals.com/richmond/inno/stories/news/2023/09/19/bonumose-sugar-virginia-funding.html) and their quest to develop scalable sugar alternatives as well as [robotic school safety company Knightscope](https://www.bizjournals.com/richmond/inno/stories/news/2023/09/19/knightscope-security-robots-richmond-vcu.html) and their roadshow in Richmond.
