This week I reported on Dominion Energy Solutions pitching [solar roofs](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/09/solar-power-being-considered-for-wjcc-schools-but-board-wants-more-time-to-consider/) to WJCC schools. It brings me back to when I reported on [solar power](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2017-11-24/austin-energys-quest-to-bring-solar-power-to-renters-and-the-less-wealthy/) in Austin.
