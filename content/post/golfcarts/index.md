Windsor Forest in James City County now permits [golf cart use on public highways,](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/15/another-neighborhood-is-approved-for-golf-cart-use-in-james-city-county/) joining four other neighborhoods. However, concerns persist about vague regulations, including passenger limits and safety for minors. Residents referenced federal regulations, but the county emphasized adherence to Virginia code. The Windsor Forest HOA will manage signage and education, with the board retaining the option to revoke the permit. Additional research on golf cart policies in other communities is underway.
