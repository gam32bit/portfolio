I published my first piece in RVA Mag about young dancer [X-Glide](https://rvamag.com/art/dancetheatre/x-glides-mission-is-putting-virginia-street-dance-on-the-map.html). As a dancer myself, I was grateful for the opportunity to give back to the Virginia dance scene as well as show off my photography more than my usual pieces.
