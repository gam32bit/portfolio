For this month's issue of Virginia Business, I wrote about the sale of [Ward Plaza in Winchester](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/winchester-shopping-center-sale-could-revitalize-area/) which city leaders hope will revitalize the area, and I also covered [Spotsylvania county's decision](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/amazon-plans-spotsylvania-data-centers/) to hopefully incentivize some of the data center companies to invest in their area, which neighbors Northern Virginia's "Data Center Alley."
