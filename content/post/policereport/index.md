[A new report](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989807-policereport) obtained by the Gazette showed that before Chief Mark Jamison took over the James City County Department, officers described it as a "toxic" agency and cited "racial tension" as a concern. I had the chance to [interview the new chief](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/25/james-city-countys-new-police-chief-sees-a-fresh-start-for-department/) and ask about his plans to correct the agency's course.
