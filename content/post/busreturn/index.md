I've reported on when [non-transportation zones](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/05/23/williamsburg-james-city-county-schools-consider-limiting-bus-service-for-those-who-live-closer-to-school/) were first announced for WJCC elementary school students, as well as the [protests against it](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/02/wjcc-parents-plead-for-bus-service-after-non-transportation-zones-go-into-effect/) when school started a few weeks ago. I also had a chance to [walk one of the routes myself](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1243086876352766) from Longhill Grove to DJ Montague. I was happy to see [this resolution](https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/09/22/school-bus-service-returns-for-some-wjcc-students/) for some students, but there are still more at Stonehouse, Norge and Laurel Lane elementary schools where this policy is still in place.
