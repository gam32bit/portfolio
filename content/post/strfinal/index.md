The Board of Supervisors approved a [couple of Special Use Permits](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/16/jcc-board-oks-pair-of-short-term-rental-applications/) against the recommendation of the planning commission this past week. These are the first cases I've reported on from start to finish since I started doing journalism in Virginia. You can read my [planning commission coverage](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/05/05/jcc-planners-split-on-three-requests-for-short-term-rental-permits/) here and the discussion at this month's [joint meeting](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/03/jcc-board-remains-unsure-about-rules-for-short-term-rentals/) to get the full story.
