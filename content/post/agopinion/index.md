Following up on [my previous story this week,](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/) the VA Attorney General released [an opinion](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/24/va-attorney-general-says-transgender-student-policies-comply-with-anti-discrimination-laws/) backing up claims made by Governor Youngkin but still not going as far as to explain how the state can impose these model policies on the treatment of transgender students on school boards if they choose not to adopt them.
