I'm excited to be covering more [James City County Board Meetings](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-james-city-county-budget-0513-20230512-4tjcmwhi7vhanix47illuvzgwq-story.html) and continuing to learn more about local politics. I also covered the [following WJCC school board meeting](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-wjcc-school-board-books-20230519-j6bw36qp2je2pcwpp6q7aecxx4-story.html) where the division approved their budget as well, including a 7% raise for teachers.
