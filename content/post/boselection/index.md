This year, James City County voters will choose new members for the Board of Supervisors, with three out of five seats available. I published [a rundown of the positions](https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/09/23/majority-of-jcc-supervisor-seats-up-for-grabs/) of incumbents John McGlennon and Ruth Larson as well as other candidates Trevor Topping, John Curran, Barbara Null, and Lisa Ownby.
