Fun fact - I actually ran a cross-country meet in high school on the Eastern State Hospital campus. Now [over 300 acres of that property is for sale](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/30/county-considers-rezoning-large-parcel-near-eastern-state-to-allow-new-homes/), although the finalized timeline of when a deal will close is still up in the air. These parcels were determined to be in excess of what the hospital needed, although my other [recent report on the shortage of state beds for psychiatric patients](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/more-patients-in-crisis-falling-through-cracks-of-state-psychiatric-commitment-system/) brings that assessment into question.
