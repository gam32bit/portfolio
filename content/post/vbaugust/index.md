I have four stories in the August Issue of Virginia Business: one on [Richmond's repeal of minimum parking requirements](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/parking-repeal-gives-developers-space/), one on a couple of [Virginia startup incubators competing for a SBA grant](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/virginia-accelerators-vie-for-sba-award/), one on a [new tuition-assistance program at MBU](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/mbu-program-makes-college-more-affordable/), and one about the city of [Bristol's switch to a new destination marketing organization in Southwest Virginia](https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/bristol-makes-tourism-marketing-switch/). 

This is the first time I've published my work in a magazine - happy to put another notch on my journalism belt! I'm currently working for other new publications as well. Stay tuned!
