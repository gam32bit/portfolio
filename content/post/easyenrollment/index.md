I've enjoyed covering [healthcare stories for the Mercury](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/more-patients-in-crisis-falling-through-cracks-of-state-psychiatric-commitment-system/), and the [easy enrollment program](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/31/over-60000-virginians-used-easy-enrollment-in-medical-assistance-programs-first-year/) is the latest subject I've reported on. The General Assembly passed a law in 2021 that puts a checkbox on state tax forms where filers can volunteer their information to get connected to resources from the Department of Medical Assistance Services. This coming tax year will be the first time that tax filers can check the same box to get connected to the state health benefits exchange which launches November 1.
