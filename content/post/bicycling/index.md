I did a preview piece on [Pedal the Parkway](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-pedal-parkway-20230503-tqagf6um2jafppdqlpgktctlci-story.html) which is happening this weekend. Can't speak for my readers but I know my wife and I were hesitant to go on the chance we could be charged the entrance fee. I also posted a video with Emil from the Bicycle Co-Op explaining how he fixes up old bikes:
