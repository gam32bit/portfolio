I attended the [Williamsburg Landing Arboretum Arbor Day](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-williamsburg-landing-arbor-day-20230502-27nk6j3qvbhd5h6hsdaha5maxm-story.html) celebration a week ago. One of the great things about reporting is learning new vocabulary like "cultivar," a plant variety produced by selective breeding. I also posted a video of Grounds lead Justin Drewery explaining how to properly plant a potted tree:
