In my [Virginia Mercury article](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/09/ai-weapons-detection-startups-compete-with-industry-giant-in-expanding-va-school-market/) published today, I created a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1prg94r0CXJullmAY8NIRUFG8QzDStGE&ehbc=2E312F) with the locations of every K-12 school shooting in Virginia from 2017 to the present. If you open the map, you can click on the markers to view details of each shooting, taken from the [K-12 School Shooting Database.](k12ssdb.org/)
