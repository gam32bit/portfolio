[The new policy](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/07/14/wjcc-schools-considers-changing-policy-on-removing-books-from-school-libraries/) takes away parents' abilities to remove books for all children at a school like [what happened earlier this year.](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/05/19/debate-over-decision-to-remove-novel-from-libraries-reaches-williamsburg-area-school-board/) It followed [a memo by the state superintendent](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/45317/638218255323200000), but I'm curious if other localities will interpret it in the same way.
