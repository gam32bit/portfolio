[Grove is a beautiful neighborhood](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/28/we-are-worthy-grove-residents-rally-for-community-improvements/) in south James City County with a rich history that unfortunately hasn't always gotten the attention it deserves. While reporting for this story I had the chance to volunteer at the Grove rec center for a beginning of summer festival, and it was a pleasure getting to meet the residents.
