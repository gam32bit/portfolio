Last month, I interviewed [Women of the Water](https://womenofthewater.wixsite.com/conference), a community for women, gender-diverse folks, and other underrepresented people in the aquaculture industry, about their recent article in Oceanography magazine.

I spoke with Co-directors Marcy Cockrell, Ph.D., CPM and Blair M. about the importance of having hard conversations, the success of their 2023 conference, and plans for the future.

You can read what they had to say in [my blog post](https://aquainfoexchange.org/interview-with-women-of-the-water/) on the [Aquaculture Information Exchange](https://aquainfoexchange.org).
