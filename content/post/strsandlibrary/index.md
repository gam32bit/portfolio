This week I had a few pieces come out in the Gazette, including my coverage of the JCC Board of Supervisors meeting. Two of the main topics of discussion were possible new regulations for [short-term rentals](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/03/jcc-board-remains-unsure-about-rules-for-short-term-rentals/) as well as plans for new [libraries](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/05/31/james-city-county-moves-forward-with-plan-to-build-new-library-facilities/).
