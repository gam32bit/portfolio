The [non-transportation zones](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/02/wjcc-parents-plead-for-bus-service-after-non-transportation-zones-go-into-effect/) means that students that live within a half mile of their school will no longer receive bus service. Back when this change was initially announced, I reported on parents who protested at [a May school board meeting](https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/05/23/williamsburg-james-city-county-schools-consider-limiting-bus-service-for-those-who-live-closer-to-school/), but now more parents are finding out and are not happy about it. The next school board meeting should be interesting.
