My wife and I were visiting the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for their annual [Science Day open house](https://www.dailypress.com/2023/06/13/open-house-gives-vims-visitors-a-closer-look-at-wonders-of-ocean-life/), and I realized I should probably write a story about it! It's amazing all of the cool places I wasn't aware of when I went to school in the area a decade ago. Definitely plan on going back!
