My first episode features a former opinions editor who started a successful Substack newsletter after he got laid off, and my second features a journalist union leader who went on strike for better wages on Feb. 1. More to come!&lt;/p>

>easy enrollment program&lt;/a> is the latest subject I&amp;rsquo;ve reported on. The General Assembly passed a law in 2021 that puts a checkbox on state tax forms where filers can volunteer their information to get connected to resources from the Department of Medical Assistance Services. This coming tax year will be the first time that tax filers can check the same box to get connected to the state health benefits exchange which launches November 1.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VA Ed Policies Not Enforceable</title><link>https://jwcaterine.com/p/va-ed-policies-not-enforceable/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 10:58:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jwcaterine.com/p/va-ed-policies-not-enforceable/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/McLean_trans_walkout-2048x1365.jpg" alt="Featured image of post VA Ed Policies Not Enforceable" />&lt;p>It does not appear that the state has anyway to force school boards to adopt the Virginia Department of Education&amp;rsquo;s model policies which make it more difficult for transgender students to go by their preferred identity at school, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that LGBTQ youth who said they had a LGBTQ-affirming school system reported lower rates of attempting suicide. A 2021 GLSEN survey of School Climate for LGBTQ+ Students in Virginia reported that only 40% of Virginian LGBTQ+ students said that their school administration was “somewhat or very supportive” of LGBTQ+ students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really admire the students and families who are organizing against these policies and led a mass walkout last year when they were first announced. You can support &lt;a class="link" href="https://prideliberation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
