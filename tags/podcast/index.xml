My first episode features a former opinions editor who started a successful Substack newsletter after he got laid off, and my second features a journalist union leader who went on strike for better wages on Feb. 1. More to come!&lt;/p>

>Round the Triangle&lt;/a> this week. For the inaugural episode, we are talking about James Blair, the co-founder of the College of William &amp;amp; Mary and, as it turns out, a slaveholder and advocate for institutionalized slavery in colonial Virginia. Despite this legacy, Blair is still honored today as the namesake of a local middle school and a hall on W&amp;amp;M campus.
