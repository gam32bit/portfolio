&lt;em>X-Glide, winner of the Study Your Arts event&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I competed and &lt;a class="link" href="https://whro.org/news/local-news/37983-study-your-arts-brings-black-club-culture-to-something-in-the-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>reported&lt;/a> on the Study Your Arts dance competition at this year&amp;rsquo;s Something in the Water festival in VA Beach. It was a blast to return to the dance scene where my artistic journey began and be able to give back by covering the event as a journalist. So much talent among the young dancers - I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what happens next. I also published a video recap on my dancer Youtube profile:&lt;/p>
