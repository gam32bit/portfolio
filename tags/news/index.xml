&lt;p>I published &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/virginia-considers-private-prison-contract-renewal-despite-4-3-million-in-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my first article in the Virginia Mercury&lt;/a> on the only privately run prison in Virginia, Lawrenceville Correctional Center. I obtained a series of memos from the Virginia Department of Corrections that showed GEO Group, the private operator, has had $4.3 million in contract breaches since 2018. I uploaded the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/lawrenceville-correctional-center-212905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>memos&lt;/a> to DocumentCloud along with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/lawrenceville-correctional-center-contract-documents-212906/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
