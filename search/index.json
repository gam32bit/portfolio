This walkthrough is based on the quickstart guide by theme author CaiJimmy, but mine includes additional steps that may be helpful for users less experienced with programming. Note that if you choose a different theme, the set up will be different, so I’d recommend following this example first to learn the basics, and then you can explore other themes after.\nWhat is Hugo?\nThis project uses Hugo, a static-site generator, “static” meaning that the elements on the webpage are the same for every user (versus “dynamic” where they change). To use Hugo, you select a “Theme” from their website, and then you can customize the configurations and add posts as markdown files. It is a more affordable alternative to sites like Squarespace or Wordpress, but it does require some grit to set up and maintain.\nYou don’t need to be a veteran programmer in order to use Hugo. You do need a GitHub account and optionally a custom domain. This is the only part that would cost money, but typically you can find something for less than $20 USD/year. I used Netlify.\nStep-by-step guide to launch website in less than an hour\nCopy theme and set up GitHub pages - On the “Stack” theme Github template, click the green “Use this template” button to clone the template as your own repository. Then, go to the settings tab of your new repository and click the “Pages” menu item on the sidebar. Under the “Branch” subheader, select “gh-pages” from the dropdown menu. (If you don’t see it immediately, wait a few minutes). Click “Save.” If you’re using a custom domain, you can enter that below and save also. Launch Codespace - Click on the “Code” tab on the top, and then click the green “Code” button, and launch a new Codespace. This takes several minutes, but it will open a virtual coding environment in the cloud, so you don’t have to install anything on your local machine. Of course if you’d rather do that, it’s certainly an option. Set up extensions and “baseurl” in config file - Go to the “Extensions” tab on the sidebar (building blocks icon) and search for “GitHub Actions.” Click the blue install button. Once the new icon appears on the sidebar, click that and make sure you’re signed in to your GitHub account so it syncs. Then, click the File Explorer tab (top-left), you can navigate to the “config.toml” file. At the top, change the link in the quotation marks next to “baseurl” to your domain. If you don’t have a custom domain, that will be “[yourgithubusername].github.io/[yourrepositoryname]”. Save the file. Use Terminal to build website - if you don’t see a terminal window at the bottom of the screen, you can create a new one from the menu at the top left. Click to the right of the “$” sign and type “hugo” and hit enter. This essentially builds your website based on the changes you made. Use Git to Launch Website - After you save, you should see a blue bubble with a number appear on one of the sidebar icons. Click it. This is where the “Git” in “GitHub” comes from - it’s a source control system, similar to how version history works if you’ve ever used that in Microsoft Word. In the box that says “Message” type in a short note to describe the changes you made, in this case something like “update baseurl” and then click the blue button that says “Commit.” Once that processes, click the blue button again to “Sync Changes.” Congrats, you can go to your domain to view your website! Customize - now that your website is up, you can customize the profile picture and social media links by making changes to the “params.toml” and “menu.toml” file. To create a new post, in the terminal type “hugo new post/[yourpostname]/index.md”, and you will see the new folder and file appear under the “post” folder in your directory. You can modify the frontmatter at the top of your index.md file and then write your post just like you would on Reddit under the dash marks. You can also embed social media posts and other things with Hugo shortcodes. Watch my video for more details on these steps. That’s it! I hope this encourages some of you to give Hugo a try. Like I said before, you’ll need grit to solve problems that come up with your Hugo site, but fortunately there is documentation for most themes you can refer to. The themes are fairly basic and to do anything fancier would require more programming knowledge. I prefer a more minimalist look anyway, so it works for me. Good luck!\n","date":"2023-08-12T02:36:09Z","image":"https://jwcaterine.com/p/portfolio-website-walkthrough/hugothumbfinal_hu68892260a910c147193633c2c7c8e3eb_860246_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://jwcaterine.com/p/portfolio-website-walkthrough/","title":"Portfolio Website Walkthrough"},{"content":"In my Virginia Mercury article published today, I created a map with the locations of every K-12 school shooting in Virginia from 2017 to the present.

For those of you who still want to get into journalism despite the many warnings about why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, I wanted to share some advice on how to start as a freelance journalist even if you have no experience. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working in the US news industry since 2016, and I never went to school for journalism.\nFor this post I want to share how you can get what you need to pitch your first article to a local paper and get paid (not much!). I realize I am oversimplifying the crap out of the process, but my goal is to show that it really is easy to get started. Just keep in mind that actually becoming a good journalist takes a lot of time and perseverance.\nLook up local meeting agendas - Google your city or county plus \u0026ldquo;agenda\u0026rdquo; and you should be able to find a website that lists local meetings with the agendas. Look through these and find something that interests you. Do you care about the environment? Look for committees dealing with that. How about affordable housing? Most localities have a planning commission. Of course, the options will depend on the population of where you live, but even if your only choice is City council, board of supervisors, or some equivalent, you can start there.\nPack your gear - When I go to local meetings I bring my camera, an ipad for notes, and an audio recorder, but really you can use your phone to do everything. Having separate tools does make it easier to multitask, so it would be best to bring some sort of notepad to write down notes. You also do not need a camera.\nGo to the meeting - okay, this sounds obvious, but I know reporters who will just watch the meeting online instead of going. Especially if it\u0026rsquo;s your first attempt at reporting, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to physically go. You will pick up on things not captured by the online video, not to mention have the opportunity to follow up with people directly during the meeting or after. I also recommend staying for the entire meeting, not just for the item you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. You never know what can happen!\nRecord audio and take notes at the meeting - You can use the video on your phone to record the audio, but also most localities post recordings of meetings shortly after. I prefer to take my own audio so I can turn it into a transcript to use later. If you hear something interesting, write it down and write the time stamp on the recording so you can reference it easily later. Pay attention to what topics members of the board/council/whatever disagree on - controversy is usually newsworthy. Keep an open mind, you may find out about something that will make for a better story than the one you initially went for.\nUse notes/audio to make a pitch - I will upload my audio to Google Drive and then use Google Pinpoint (free for journalists) to turn the audio into a transcript. Others have raised concerns about uploading interview recordings to the internet, but in this case what you recorded is public anyway. You do not have to do this step, but in my experience it makes it easier to look up details based on my notes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! You have everything you need at this point to write a pitch to send to a local paper. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning how to write a pitch, use Chat-GPT! Lol jk jk - if y\u0026rsquo;all want a tutorial on making a pitch or anything else, let me know and I\u0026rsquo;ll make more videos and posts like this one!\nI do want to reiterate what other people have said on this subreddit - the journalism industry is really bad for the average reporter right now, especially freelancers. Also, I am proof that you can get into the industry with no experience, but I also went to college where I learned how to write. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to go to college to get started as a journalist, but you do need to know how to write.\nThat being said, I wanted to share this because I haven\u0026rsquo;t given up on journalism as a profession (yet), and it\u0026rsquo;s been encouraging to me to see all the people who have posted on this sub wanting to learn the craft. I hope this post helps y\u0026rsquo;all on that journey. Good luck!\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2023-07-22T10:58:54-04:00","permalink":"https://jwcaterine.com/p/journalism-101/","title":"Journalism 101"},{"content":"Better sidewalks and new bike lanes are coming to the area around the Norge Shopping Center.
